# Splunk Firewall Dashboard

## Introduction
In this project, I created a Splunk firewall dashboard. This dashboard shows various metrics based on the selected time range.
The metrics are the total number of connections, number of dropped connections, number of allowed connections, and potential malicious intrusion attempts.
This dashboard also has the ability to drill down and filter events/connections based on the selected firewall actions.
