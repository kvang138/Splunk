# Splunk Firewall Sentinel

## Introduction
In this project, I created a Splunk-based Firewall Monitoring Dashboard to provide security teams with clear, actionable visibility into network traffic and potential threats.
The dashboard dynamically displays essential metrics over any chosen time window: total connections, allowed vs. dropped traffic, and indicators of possible malicious intrusion attempts.
To support deeper analysis, I incorporated intuitive drill-down and filtering controls, allowing users to narrow down data by:

Geographic location (country → region → city)
Firewall action (allow, block, drop, etc.)

This enables fast pivoting from high-level trends to specific events or suspicious connections—streamlining threat detection, troubleshooting, and compliance reporting.

## Tools/Languages used.
- Splunk and SPL
- Python

## Conclusion
I created this Splunk Firewall Sentinel dashboard to provide comprehensive, at-a-glance visibility into firewall logs and network activity, enabling rapid detection of anomalies, policy violations, and potential malicious intrusions to strengthen perimeter security monitoring.
